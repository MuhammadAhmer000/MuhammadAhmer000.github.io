I am Muhammad Ahmer, a Computer Science graduate from the American University of Sharjah. My interests lie in applying computational and data-driven methods to practical problems, particularly in areas where technology interacts with real-world decision-making, systems, and human behavior.

My background includes work in machine learning, data analysis, and software development, along with academic research exploring how quantitative techniques can be used to study emerging digital ecosystems. I am especially interested in building tools, running experiments, and translating theoretical concepts into working implementations.

This website serves as a record of my projects, technical explorations, and continued learning. Rather than being a static portfolio, it is meant to reflect my development over time as I deepen my understanding of computer science and its applications.

Outside of coursework and research, I enjoy exploring new technical topics, refining ideas through hands-on experimentation, and revisiting foundational concepts to better understand how systems work from the ground up.

You can also find my academic writing and publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NZ-L2wwAAAAJ&hl=en).
